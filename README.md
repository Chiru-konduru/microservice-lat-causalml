# Root Cause Analysis of Elevated Latencies in a Microservice Architecture
This case study focuses on identifying the root causes of unexpected latencies observed in cloud services supporting an online shop. The primary focus is on the order placement process, which involves several services to ensure the validity of the order, customer authentication, accurate calculation of shipping costs, and initiation of the shipping process. The dependencies of these services are depicted in the graph below.

# Objectives
- Identify the root causes of elevated latencies in the microservice architecture.
- Analyze the dependencies between different services in the order placement process.
- Propose and implement mitigation strategies to alleviate the identified latency issues.
